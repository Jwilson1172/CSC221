# PURPOSE:
<t>To write a simple Python program.  To use quotient-remainder arithmetic. To
properly document a program.

# PROBLEM:

- Write a Python program to read time measurements from the keyboard in
hours and minutes.  There will be two data sets.  The first will be the hours and
minutes for the first time, the second the hours and minutes for the second time.
<br>
- Add the two data sets and calculate the result in hours and minutes.  Use
quotient remainder arithmetic.



### note the quotient is the number of times n fits into num and can be found using int div using //.

### the remainder is what is left over from the int div or quotient and can be found using the mod operator %.



- The minutes in the final answer should be less
than 60.  Also calculate the answer as a real number representing the number of
hours.
<br>
- The program should be well documented and it should contain comments
describing what you are doing.
<br>
- The input data should look similar to what is below. Make sure that you
use prompt for your input.  The program should work for any positive whole
number input data, not just the numbers provided.

# SAMPLE INPUT:

```
5
39
6
52
```

The above shows the first data set of 5 hours 39 minutes. While the second data set is 6
hours 52 minutes.

# SAMPLE OUTPUT:

```
12 hours 31 minutes
12.52 hours
```
# TO SUBMIT:
- Submit a .py file named `Dev1.py` to Canvas

# GRADING:
Partial credit will be given at the instructorâ€™s discretion
If your application does not run you will lose 60% of the points automatically
The input portion is worth 30% of the grade
The calculations are worth 40% of the grade
The output portion is worth 30% of the grade
